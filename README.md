Pairfy is an electronic commerce protocol that uses smart contracts to decentralize functional requirements necessary for the processes of selling and buying a physical product. Any member of the community can post a product for sale and any member of the community can express an intention to purchase that product. The slot of a product is a concept that represents the availability to open a negotiation session similar to a sell order on a DEX. A negotiation session is defined as the process of trading a product for a limited time. During the session the buyer and seller generate the negotiation context by engaging in bilateral communication through live chat via websocket. If there is a dispute situation during the session it is possible to use the appeal resource so that a group of three mediators decide on the specific case according to the fulfillment of the obligations of the buyer and the seller. The fundamental idea of Pairfy is to avoid using expensive infrastructure and oracles as a source of truth. Instead, use mediators as a source of truth in a disputed negotiation session.
