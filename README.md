# Introduction

Pairfy is a native Cardano e-commerce dApp funded in the Catalyst F11 round.

Imagine a platform like Amazon or Shopify but governed and operated by its own buyers and sellers as DAO members,
who can vote on key platform decisions and access a shared repository of vendor profiles, product templates, marketing assets, and landing page designs.

On Pairfy, products can be purchased using a Cardano or Midnight wallet. The trading process between the seller and the buyer is handled by Plutus V3 contracts.
Using a Cardano smart-contract allows to use **_ADA_**, **_stablecoin_** and **_native asset_** as a form of payment for the products.
In addition, the implementation of other innovative and deterministic trading logics. It is also compatible with the **_midnight network._**

Pairfy also leverages the collective intelligence of its DAO members to conduct market and product research that benefits the Cardano community.
These features empower any community member to become a seller and launch their own store.
