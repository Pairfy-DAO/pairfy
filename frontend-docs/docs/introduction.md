# Introduction

Pairfy is a decentralized application for trading physical products.
It is a community-governed e-commerce that uses blockchain technology and artificial intelligence to generate a comprehensive value exchange ecosystem.

The trade between the seller and the buyer is managed by smart contracts or individual Plutus scripts.
Using a Cardano smart-contract allows to use **_ADA_**, **_stablecoin_** and **_native asset_** as a form of payment for the products.
In addition, the implementation of other innovative and deterministic trading logics. It is compatible with the midnight network.

#### Differential factors

- Community-governed with chain vote (DAO model).
- The **liquidity pool** to reduce the price of products.
- Use of Cardano Network ‚Äì Midnight Network üî•.
- Each trade is managed by an isolated smart-contract.
- Any member of the community can be a seller.
- Community repository of products and templates.
- Seller incentive program.
- Open-source development (Apache 2.0).
- Integration of AI models.
- Product search by AI vectorized semantics.

#### Competitive factors

The most competitive factor is the discount liquidity pool which is fueled by trade fees and ADA generated through staking.
This helps leverage product prices, reducing them by 10% to 25% from traditional market prices.

_Example_

::: tip
Although the price of ADA / USD may fluctuate depending on when this is read the long-term trend is considered bullish. For the purposes of this example the reference value of **1 ADA = 1 USD** will be used.
:::


If the liquidity pool reaches 1.000.000 ADA this liquidity can be
divided by 100 ADA as a form of discount for each buy order.

```md
discount_liquidity = 1_000_000 ADA

order_discount = 100 ADA

discount_liquidity / order_discount = 10_000 discounts

Beneficiaries: 10.000 users
```

This means that 10,000 buy orders will have a discount of 100 ADA.
Which for products over $200 represents a pretty substantial discount. 
A very generous discount is a good incentive to encourage traditional market buyers to migrate to the Cardano ecosystem.


Here's another example with an iPhone:


```md
discount_liquidity = 100_000 ADA

order_discount = 200 ADA

discount_liquidity / order_discount = 2_500 discounts (2.500 Beneficiaries)

Iphone 17 price = 1000USD

Iphone 17 with discount = 800USD
```
#### Technical aspects of the discount pool and the staking pool.

The discount pool grows with the ADA fees contributed by sellers for each sale
and with the ADA rewards generated by the staking pool.
All ADA is sent to the operating wallet which is delegated to the pool itself and allows for generating profits through staking.

In the distribution stage ( airdrop ) the ADA will be transferred to the discount pool a smart contract with an endpoint that mints the tokens needed to distribute the liquidity for the discounts.
Each token represents an individual discount (1 token = 1 beneficiary).
Tokens are airdropped to the wallets of $PAIRFY holders during the liquidity distribution stage airdrop.

In the user interface during a purchase process. The buyer sees the option to redeem the token as a discount in the right panel.
If the user agrees to do so, they only need to pay the discounted price.

When the buyer makes the purchase, the transaction sends the redeemable token to the individual contract that handles the trade logic.
When the commerce ends, the contract that handles the trade logic sends the redeemable token to the seller who can redeem it for ADA.
The smart contract that manages the discount liquidity uses a state machine and a threadtoken to perform deterministic redemption.

With the goal of staking 10,000,000 ADA consistently for a year, stakers would earn rewards in ADA and $PAIRFY for staking.
This would then generate at least 200,000 ADA annually and 16,666 ADA monthly, returned to all holders in the form of a discount.
This is a decent achievement.

In addition, the amount generated by the fee for each sale must be added.
Averaging the fee charged by large private e-commerce companies 10% for each sale of any type of product is a realistic and understandable percentage.
This means that for every $100, $10 is sent to staking.

#### Staking rewards

$PAIRFY utility/governance tokens is distributed as a reward for delegating ADA to staking pools.

#### Paradigm revolution

Using Turing-complete smart contracts enables high levels of innovation that dwarf traditional and centralized applications.
Applications that are currently Web 2 will eventually be replaced by Web 3.
Even large tech companies will have to adapt to this change or else disappear.
The open source community is a giant.
It allows for the distribution of value based on merit and opportunity, enables transparency, and highlights the power of community governance.
Closed source, telemetry, private data collection, will pass.
