# Introduction

Pairfy is a community-governed application for trading physical products.
It is characterized by using blockchain technology and artificial intelligence to create a e-commerce ecosystem.
Cardano's E-UTXO model provides deterministic security for transactions and contract state changes.
Using a Cardano smart contract provides the benefit of being able to use **_ADA_** as a form of payment for the products, and even any **_stablecoin_** and **_native asset_**.
Each purchase of a product is managed by a separate smart contract which contains a state machine that ensures secure and efficient trade.



#### Differential factors

- Community-governed with high transparency.
- Each trade is an isolated smart-contract.
- Liquidity pool to reduce the price of products.
- Use of Cardano Network â€“ Midnight Network.
- Any member of the community can be a seller.
- Community repository of products and templates.
- Seller incentive program.
- Open-source development.
- Integration of AI models.
- Product search by vectorized semantics.

#### Competitive factors

Pairfy's most competitive factor is its discount liquidity pool which is fueled by sales fees and ADA generated through staking.
This helps leverage product prices, reducing them by 10% to 25% from traditional market prices.

_Example_

Although the price of ADAUSD may fluctuate depending on the time you read this, 
the price is bullish in the long term, so for this example 1 ADA = 1 USD will be used.

If the liquidity pool reaches 1.000.000 ADA this liquidity can be
divided by 100 ADA as discount_per_order

```md
discount_per_order = 100 ADA

1_000_000 ADA / discount_per_order = 10_000 discounts

Beneficiaries: 10_000 users
```

This means that 10,000 buy orders will have a discount of 100 ADA.
Which for products over $200 represents a pretty substantial discount. 
A very generous discount is a good incentive to encourage traditional market buyers to migrate to the Cardano ecosystem.


_Here's another example with an iPhone:_


```md
discount_per_order = 200 ADA

500_000 ADA / discount_per_order = 2_500 discounts

Original Iphone 17 price = 1000USD
Price with discount applied = 800USD

Beneficiaries: 2_500 users 

```


The community can vote to set the pool cap and the `discount_per_order` value.

#### Paradigm revolution

Using Turing-complete smart contracts enables high levels of innovation that dwarf traditional, private, and centralized applications.
Applications that are currently Web 2 will eventually be replaced by Web 3.
Even large tech companies will have to adapt to this change or else disappear.
The open source community is a giant that can never be defeated.
It allows for the distribution of value based on merit and opportunity, enables transparency, and highlights the power of community governance.
Closed source, telemetry, data collection, will pass.



## Syntax Highlighting

VitePress provides Syntax Highlighting powered by [Shiki](https://github.com/shikijs/shiki), with additional features like line-highlighting:

**Input**

````md
```js{4}
export default {
  data () {
    return {
      msg: 'Highlighted!'
    }
  }
}
```
````

**Output**

```js{4}
export default {
  data () {
    return {
      msg: 'Highlighted!'
    }
  }
}
```
